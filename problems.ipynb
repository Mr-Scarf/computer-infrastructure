    "\n",
    "This assignment is an analysis of the famous 5 FAANG companies hourly stock data across the most recent 5 day period. The FAANG companies are among the largest techoligical companies in the world & have historically made up a significant % weighting of the Market Capitalisation of the  S&P 500 in the early 2020s. ([CNBC, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/13/five-biggest-stocks-dwarfing-the-market-at-unprecedented-level.html)).\n",

    "The goal of the assigment is to demonstrate tools learned in the module, such as using python tools to collect,analyse,visulise, and schedule automation of a workflow, stock data prices in this example.\n",
    "The assignement is divided into four problems, briefly summarised below. Each will be explored in more detail throughout the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection - Download & save stock data**\n",
    "Using the yfinance python module, we download the market data, store it in a csv file with a timestamped naming convention.\n",

    "2. **Data Visulisation - Plotting stock data**\n",
    "Show a plot with the closing prices of each stock & save in a png file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Script Creation - Create a script to automate the download/saving/plotting of stock data**\n",
    "We will create a python script that runs the problems 1 & 2 automatically - downlaoding the latest data &showing plot of said data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Workflow Automation - Automate the script using Github Actions**\n",
    "Use GitHub Actions workflow to automate running the script weekly every Saturday morning.\n",

    "**GitHub Actions** is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) system that lets you automate tasks such as building, testing, and running scripts. Workflows run automatically in response to events—like pushing code to the repository—or on a defined schedule, for example,  as in this case running the FAANG code every Saturday morning.  \n",

    "**YML or YAML** -  YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language, but it originally stood for Yet Another Markup Language - is human readable data serialization language that is similar to JSON and XML files.Serialization is a process where one application or service that has different data structures and is written in a different set of technologies can transfer data to another application using a standard format.\n",
    "Serialization is about translating, converting, and wrapping up a data structure in another format.\n",
    "The data in the new format can be stored in a file or transmitted to another application or service over a network.\n",
    "YAML is a widely used format for writing configuration files for different DevOps tools, programs, and applications because of its human-readable and intuitive syntax.  \n",
